#  Project

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is intended to be run **only on a local machine**. Running it on cloud-based environments or remote servers may lead to unexpected behavior or require additional configurations.

## 📌 Description

This project implements and explores the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) object detection model using a Jupyter Notebook. The notebook contains code for loading, training, and testing the YOLOv8 model on a dataset.

## 🛠 Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the notebook:

- ✅ Python 3.8+
- ✅ Jupyter Notebook
- ✅ Ultralytics YOLOv8
- ✅ OpenCV
- ✅ Numpy
- ✅ Matplotlib

Install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <[repository-url](https://github.com/ShreyashDarade/YOLOv8_Nano-Real-Time-Object-Detection)>
   cd <[repository-folde](https://github.com/ShreyashDarade/YOLOv8_Nano-Real-Time-Object-Detection)r>
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook YOLOV8.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the cells sequentially to execute the code.
